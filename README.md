This project is a web application built using React, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It leverages an API to fetch and display data dynamically. The primary goal of the project is to understand the concepts of severous techniques including api usage, redux etc.
Library I used was mainly Material-UI (https://mui.com)

Currently language is set to German only, if you want to use this Spotify Clone in your language, you'll have to change some stuff manually.

Fetching different kind of parameters, like: Your currently playing Spotify Track, your playlists and tracks, your Avatar/Userinfo, featured playlists etc.

Project took around 5 Days to complete, not responsive on all screensizes. Tested with FHD (1920x1080) and WQHD (2560x1440) Monitors.

If you want to use this project, you'll need to create a new Project in the Spotify API and change the redirect_url in the Login.tsx file to your localhost (The same one should be on the Spotify API Dashboard).
